        The bulk of these projects will be based on the course that I'm doing, can't guarantee that they'll be efficient solutions
        but they'll get the job done.

        There will be a mix of languages used, Java will probably be the main one used over time but other languages will probably
        make an appearance.

        This site will also be used as a way of easily accessing the notes that I make for both independent learning and knowledge
        and understanding requirements of the course I am taking.

        and session handling in conjunction with the previous two.

    <p style="text-align:center;">
      Before I start on actual useful contents, my array of half finished and slightly broken discord bots can be found below with
      links to their github repo's. No idea why you would look at them or try putting them to use becuase even I don't like
      them anymore.

        The first bot I have to show is my Discord4J based bot, which was made to emulate the Thanos *snap* from infinity war. It
        took some time to learn as I am fairly new to Java and the use of API's, but I got there in the end. It takes the
        list of all members, evenly splits it (rounds up if odd), and then bans the users (only mentions unless serious).
